            <h2>HACKATHON</h2>
            <h5>SVECW HACKATHON by DEPT of IT, DEC 2, 2022</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px;">
              <img src="image\hackathon.jpg" style="height:4cm;width:8cm;"><img src="image\hackathon1.jpg" style="height: 4cm;width: 5cm;">
            </div>
            <p>Participating in a hackathon can be an exciting and challenging experience, and when you are the only junior among seniors, it can be even more daunting. However, it can also be a valuable opportunity to learn, grow, and showcase your skills.
              Being the only junior in a hackathon can feel intimidating at first, but it is important to remember that everyone is there to collaborate and work towards a common goal. You may feel like you have less experience than the other participants, but that does not mean you have less to offer. In fact, your unique perspective and fresh ideas can be a real asset to your team.
              To make the most of your participation in the hackathon, it is important to be proactive and communicate clearly with your team. This means speaking up and sharing your ideas, asking questions, and seeking feedback. It is also important to listen to the ideas and perspectives of your team members and work collaboratively towards a solution.
              Another way to make the most of the experience is to be open to learning from the other participants. Senior participants may have more experience or knowledge in certain areas, and you can learn from them by asking questions, observing their approach to problem-solving, and seeking their advice.
              It is also important to remember to take care of yourself during the hackathon. This means taking breaks when you need to, staying hydrated, and getting enough rest. It can be tempting to work around the clock to meet a deadline, but it is important to prioritize your well-being.
              At the end of the hackathon, win or lose, you will have gained valuable experience, learned from others, and demonstrated your skills and abilities. You may also have formed new connections and friendships with your fellow participants, which can be valuable resources for future projects and collaborations.
              In conclusion, participating in a hackathon with seniors as the only junior can be a challenging but rewarding experience. By being proactive, communicating clearly, and being open to learning from others, you can make the most of the opportunity and demonstrate your skills and abilities

            <h2>DEBATE COMPETITION</h2>
            <h5>ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN  , DEC 2, 2022</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">

            </div>
            <p>Winning a debate competition on violence against women can be a powerful experience. Not only does it showcase your ability to research, construct arguments, and articulate your position, but it also allows you to be a voice for those who may not have one. The issue of violence against women is a critical one, and it requires a nuanced and empathetic approach to address.
              To win a debate competition on violence against women, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the issue. This means researching the prevalence and causes of violence against women, as well as the impact it has on individuals and society as a whole. It is also important to understand the various forms of violence that women experience, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.
              Once you have a solid understanding of the issue, it is time to construct your arguments. One effective way to approach this is to use statistics and evidence to support your position. For example, you could highlight the fact that 1 in 3 women globally have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, or that women who experience domestic violence are at a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.
              Another approach is to use real-life examples and personal stories to illustrate the impact of violence against women. This could involve sharing stories of women who have experienced abuse and the devastating effects it has had on their lives, as well as highlighting the importance of support and resources for survivors.
              In addition to presenting a strong argument, it is important to communicate your position clearly and persuasively. This means speaking confidently and using language that is accessible and easy to understand. It is also important to actively engage with your audience, whether that be judges or fellow debaters, by acknowledging their perspectives and responding to their points in a respectful and thoughtful way.
              Ultimately, winning a debate competition on violence against women is about more than just the competition itself. It is about using your voice to make a difference, to raise awareness of a critical issue, and to advocate for change. It is an opportunity to challenge harmful attitudes and behaviors, and to promote respect, equality, and dignity for all.

            <p> I am excited to share with you that I recently participated in a poster presentation competition on the topic of violence against women. This is a topic that I am passionate about, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my insights with others.
              It was inspiring to see the innovative and thought-provoking research being conducted in this field, and I am grateful to have been a part of it.
              My poster presentation focused on the impact of cultural norms on attitudes towards violence against women. The findings of my research highlighted the need for cultural interventions and education to address the root causes of violence against women.
              Participating in this competition was a valuable learning experience for me. It allowed me to refine my research skills and communication abilities and provided me with the opportunity to receive feedback from experts in the field.
              I believe that we can create a safer and more equitable world for women by continuing to have these conversations and by taking action to address the underlying causes of violence against women. It is my hope that my research will contribute to this important cause and help to make a positive impact in the lives of women around the world.
              Thank you for your support and encouragement, and I look forward to sharing more updates on my research in the future.
